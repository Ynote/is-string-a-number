## unreleased

Breaking changes:
- Rename the module `is-plain-number` to `is-string-a-number`: after some
  thoughts, I realised that the purpose of my module was to specifically check
  if a `string` value was representing a number in decimal base and notation.
- Only check `string` values. `number` values are not accepted anymore.
